Gay Marriage. I'm an agnostic so in no way does my religion conflict with this matter. I'm an avid gay rights supporter. Marriage, is said to be the marriage of 2 people who love and care about each other. Some Straight couples just get married for the benefit of getting kids. So is that right in any case? What is the purpose of marriage if 2 people only get married to reap its benefits? I.e Have kids? As we are living in a developing society, more and more and more people are coming to terms and agreeing that gay marriage is ok.	0.9967754937525192
It's ok for the parent to spank the child as long as it's not often or they don't use other things like a belt.	0.9499049922266368
Although being fatherless is probably one of the biggest hardships, undesired by all. I would rather be fatherless, than to have to deal with someone who on a daily basis would frustrate me. At least when you have no knowledge of a father, you only ponder on it from time to time. On the other hand, a lousy father would be with you in your thoughts forever.	0.9798756261875974
I think you should hit you kids because if they did something really bad like crash your car or steal you need to hit them so they know that they should not be doing that.	0.9347325387228653
"That's your best argument - ""Because they don't"" ? <br/> I thought there was a reason for everything... <br/> I don't see the squirrel outside my window evolving. In fact, I'm pretty sure squirrels have looked and acted the same for thousands of years. <br/> How does an animal aquire a trait that he wasn't born with? Does he just wish for it really hard and it magically grows? <br/> And you proved my point - ""species have certain characteristics and properties"" <br/> I noticed you didn't mention that their characteristics randomly change <br/> And by the way, I'm just wondering because I'm a curious person... <br/> what insects are you talking about?"	0.9936085679737433
I would rather have a lousy father than being fatherless because I would at least have the tranquility of knowing who my father is than spending my whole life wondering who he was. If I was to grow up fatherless I would grow with an emptiness in me. I would prefer growing up with a lousy father and learn from his mistakes than not having a father at all.	0.9859503656359763
Honestly, I Think It's better to try a different option besides spanking that can affect a child's way of thinking and may get depressed	0.9718431508032475
"Define ""order and detail."" Existence isn't a BMW. You are falling for the old 'watch maker' argument. You fail to recognize the significance of self replicating systems within a naturally selecting environment. A good read: ""The Selfish Gene"" by Richard Dawkins. Not as aggressive as his more recent ""The God Dilusion,"" and equally well written."	0.9911326078194277

Fathers can sometimes be lousy, but it is through their mistakes that we can learn to become better parents. Dads are meant to be that icon that motivates you to surpass them. You can't have a healthy family without having two parents to guide you in life. No matter what, dads are the people you look up the most, no matter how tall you've grown.	0.9815166695456902
I would turn him in because he murdered someone. Don't get me worng I would try to persuade him first to turn himself in but if that didn't happen I would have to take reponsiblity for him. Plus I wouldn't want to feel the guilt of always knowing that I didn't turn that murder in. If he truly loved me I wouldn't have killed someone.	0.9831289226694306
INDIA has the potential to lead the world. <br/> Full of natural resources, filled with highly spiritual people and country with diverse tounges and races.

I personally feel that it is better to be fatherless, rather than having a lousy father. I personally know what it is like . My father was very lousy. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and i havn't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I don't know him, and because he's not around I am never set up for any disapointment. So I think that to be fatherless is much better.	0.9702884781482122
I feel like it is better to do both, but in order to help others you need to help yourself. It all starts with your personal goals before you can help others.	0.9631772902631428
Right Now, In My opinion to be fatherless. Trust me I Went through it. Sometimes I wish I Had a Lousy Father but Yet Not having A Father is so much better. It's been Eighteen Years since I've seen my Father but if he doesn't care then why should I? If he wanted to be in My life he could've been in my life. But being Fatherless is not bad because I have My Mother and To me that's My Father. I would rather have a Father who want to pay attention to me and actually be supportive of me.	0.9719007312719525
I feel like it's better to have a lousy father than to not have one at all. If someone is bad at something, it means that there's always a possibility that one day they may be good at it. To be fatherless, there's not even a chance of having a good father. So to have a lousy father would be better.	0.9702308976795071

Raffles conceived a town plan to remodel Singapore into a modern city. The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools and lands for government buildings. In October 1822, a Town Plan Committee was formed by Raffles to oversee the project.	0.9867564921978467
I try to see things in both ways, but even though sometimes Ill rather have a fatherless father I think having a lousy father would be better for me because in order to grow up and be ready for life you have to learn about life and if you do not have an image or person to look up life could become harder or not good.	0.5014970921863303

I believe personal pursuit its better, because its your job to decide what you want to do with your life. Your not always going to have someone by your side telling you whats right or wrong. Its all on you of reaching their goals. Its also a good thing to help other reach their succeed their goals.	0.9695975125237519

"The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms. One reason is to ""reduce bullying"", which in reality, doesn't even address the problem concerning bullying. The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality."	1.0
I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.	0.8941095180514772
Advancing the common good is much better. From the very first day our parents or our teachers have taught us about team work. <br/> The whole point of doing community service is about the common good. We have to help others in order to help our selves.	0.9589163355789716

"To be able to have a succeful trading port you must have good contacts with many people and raffles had those contacts without him we would not have a trading port at all! I would like to mention that raffles had all the important qualities of a founder and he was in good position to do so. He invested a lot and we therefore credit him as our founder! We say Obama is the ""founder"" of health reform WHY because he was in such a high position and he could do something like invest money time and effort in such a project."	0.9860367363390338
Another reason for wearing a school uniform is good is that the uniform will always be decent. It will cover every part of the body that the school doesnt want the children to show and the students would not be cauntious about what they are wearing.	0.9910750273507226
If you want your kids to wear uniforms, go to a school that allows that. But don't go crying to me that your kids are underachieving, easily-distracted, derelicts that can't focus their attention for 5 minutes in class. <br/> Maybe I'm exaggerating. <br/> But my message is clear. Uniforms are here to prevent problems that not wearing uniforms would cause.	0.9696838832268097

I feel like a personal pursuit is better. You can't help others around you if you can't help yourself. If your personal pursuit is to make money for the needy or the common good, then it starts with you and your desire to make that money. A personal pursuit isn't always about money but it can also about happiness, love, and success.	0.983215293372488

A lousy father would be able to teach you more than no one at all. Maybe he will be able to teach what not to be like, how not to act, how not to treat your family. That is better than no teaching at all I think. He could toughen you up. Also you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy, you already know.	0.9788103875165542
It is a good thing because this shows that the school and everyone else accepts each other no matter where they come from, who they are or what religion they are.	0.9816318304831003
I believe that personal pursuit is better because one must themselves happy before they can go out into the world and try to make everyone else happy. If you try to make everyone else happy and you leave no time for you, then you become a wreak and then you have no happiness in your life. Some people find that helping others is their own pursuit of happiness.	0.9831865031381357
In my opinion, I strongly agree that parents should use spanking as an option to discipline their children because the spankings are painful enough for children to learn to avoid doing the wrong things.	0.9993378246098925
