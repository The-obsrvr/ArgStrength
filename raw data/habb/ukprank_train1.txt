Bottled water is not our biggest problem when it comes to drinking habits. All other beverages consume huge amounts of water and energy during their production processes, which makes their ecological impact far more detrimental than that of bottled water. http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&address;=103x347180	0.9922554269591756	ban-plastic-water-bottles_no-bad-for-the-economy

There are still other countries who are more progressive, more literated, more powerful than India, like the USA, United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, etc. This nation doesn't have yet enought potentials and ability to sustain the needs of the people.

I vote for Firefox, because in my experience it has worked multiple times better than Internet Explorer. The config isn't too bad, and those of you who know about:config know what I'm talking about. The tabs are great, and has many good extensions. Though not the best, it is definately superior to Internet Explorer.

The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.	0.9951632406287787	evolution-vs-creation_creation

Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him. I would rather him never exist than come in and out of my life.	0.9763920078309438	is-it-better-to-have-a-lousy-father-or-to-be-fatherless-_fatherless

Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper. During those vital years of childhood having a bad dad isn't something that one forgets easily. Not only does it alter self confidence and self worth, it can covertly brand those bad habits in the mind of the child. The characteristics of an unfit parent are poisonous. I believe that it is better to be fatherless, rather than have a lousy father. Yes, it will take much effort to fill the shoes of the missing party, but it can and should be done.	0.9876201992284218	is-it-better-to-have-a-lousy-father-or-to-be-fatherless-_fatherless

In 2006, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation and the American Beverage Association worked together to develop a set of National School Beverage Guidelines. This was prepared to reduce the calories delivered to schools by beverage companies and in return promote healthier school choices for children. The articles illustrate the program and significant results thus far. Since its inception there has been a 58% cut in total calories contained in all beverages shipped to schools. Further, a survey was taken of parents, pediatricians and family physicians. The highest supported choice for each group was bottled water.

Evolution is a science. All the refutes I have seen (which I will rebuttal after this) have nothing to do with science. Their claims are theological claims. Lets first know what science is. Science is known through the scientific method. The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation.

In my opinion it is better to be fatherless then to have a lousy father. I say this because if you have a lousy father than you have to deal with him and be ashamed of him. You would have to go day by day and know he is never going to be anything special, especially for you. But if you don't have a father you can always look up to someone else for that father figure.	0.965854782057926	is-it-better-to-have-a-lousy-father-or-to-be-fatherless-_fatherless

It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. I believe that being fatherless is better then having a lousy father. The reason I believe this is the best is because you dont want to be looking up to a guy that does nothing in life and its just setting bad examples. Who knows you might grow up following his steps. So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there.

I fell like advancing the common goods is better than personal pursuit because most people will look out for themselves rather than look out for others. Looking out for yourself before lookin out for others won't do alot of good in the long run.

Americans spend billions on bottled water every year. Banning their sale would greatly hurt an already struggling economy. In addition to the actual sale of water bottles, the plastics that they are made out of, and the advertising on both the bottles and packaging are also big business. In addition to this, compostable waters bottle are also coming onto the market, these can be used instead of plastics to eliminate that detriment. Moreover, bottled water not only has a cleaner safety record than municipal water, but it easier to trace when a potential health risk does occur. <br/> (http://www.friendsjournal.org/bottled-water) (http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/bottled/)	0.9962860597685265	ban-plastic-water-bottles_no-bad-for-the-economy

I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older.

Honestly, I'd rather be completely fatherless, not saying that not having is better than having one, albeit a lousy one. However, I do believe that you can grow up completely fatherless and without any major male role model and still be successful. Take myself for example; I lived the first thirteen years of my life without a father or any fatherly interaction, and those were the essential times a kid needed to be around his/her father, I turned out great(Self-opinion).

I believe that both are bad but I would rather go fatherless. What is the point of having someone in your life that is lousy? A father should set a good example for their children. If the dad is lousy then he is teaching his kids that it is okay to be that way and not do anything with their life. If I got married and my husband was a lousy father, I would tell him he better step up and be the dad I know he can be or get out the house a never come back.	0.9505671676167443	is-it-better-to-have-a-lousy-father-or-to-be-fatherless-_fatherless
I think it's better to have a lousy father than to be fatherless because, growing up without a father can be hard for some kids.

A person should be free to do as he or she pleases. So in my opinion i really dont care much about gay marriage.

Personal pursuit because you improve your self for others and the enviorment around you, and then advancing the common good, because the goods help you and others improve. Life isn't perfect and we don't live in a perfect world and I don't expect it to be that way.

I rather be fatherless then having a lousy father because of this is that I wouldn't want to know how lousy he is and how bad he is of being a father. Being alone with just a mother is fine with me. It's just how I am. I wouldn't want to have a alcohlic father who drinks on the couch all day and curses my mother.

Yes I do feel that the consumption of water bottles should not be allowed anywhere unless in the case of emergency. Plastic bottles can leak chemicals after a period of time. Water bottles also are almost never recycled, and end up in landfills which lead to pollution of our environment. They take 700 years to start to decompose. 90% of the cost is the bottle itself... The water is usually tap water, and is not regulated. Even if tap water is dirty, you can easily clean it out with leaves, moss, and some water cleanser.

To me, a founder would be a leader, well respected by the organisation/group he is managing. Both Raffles and Farquhar were good leaders. However, when William Farquhar was sent off to Britain, more people went to send him off than the combined number of people that sent Raffles off during the three times Raffles left Singapore. This shows that the people of Singapore respected Farquhar more than Raffles, and to them, Farquhar was a more competent leader.	0.9902401105544999	william-farquhar-ought-to-be-honoured-as-the-rightful-founder-of-singapore_yes-of-course-

I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient.

It's better to be fatherless. Having a lousy father creates a bigger gap in your life than being fatherless. It is a proven fact that if you're a girl, you'll look for someone to be your other half that's similar to your father. Having a lousy father, for a girl, would mean having a lousy boyfriend as well. By having no father you don't have to worry about how terrible they are and all you have to do is ponder how amazing your dad could have been.

While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality."	1.0	is-the-school-uniform-a-good-or-bad-idea-_bad

I think it's better to be fatherless because having someone to look up to, I'd rather choose no father than having a uncaring and lousy father there to be a stain in my life. I wouldn't look up to him and he doesn't necessarily have to be the fatherly figure I have to look up to.	0.8426613692635458	is-it-better-to-have-a-lousy-father-or-to-be-fatherless-_fatherless

If my husband had committed a murder I think I would not turn him in because my feelings would be stronger that the fear of having a bad husband, I am not sure of my exact answer but I am sure that I couldn't look at him everyday and act like nothing happened, I believe that feeling are stronger than anything and I would not like the fact that he would probably be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.	0.9882823746185293	if-your-spouse-committed-murder-and-he-or-she-confided-in-you-would-you-turn-them-in-_no

It is unnecessary, as well as being quite unrelated to how a child develops into an adult. There are children who were spanked growing up who grow up to be terrible adults, and children who were not spanked growing up who become good or even great adults.	0.988483906258997	human-growth-and-development-should-parents-use-spanking-as-an-option-to-discipline-_no
In a school all the students may not belong to the same financial status . Some may be rich , some may not be that rich . So uniform provides equal status to all the students so that there is no gap among them . If there is no uniform , then the rich students will wear new dresses everyday which the other students cannot afford and may lead to resentment among them . <br/> Some insensitive children may also mock other students wear old cloths . <br/> So I beleive that uniform is essential especially in developing countries .	0.9979271031266196	is-the-school-uniform-a-good-or-bad-idea-_good
