First, although in today's society I agree that there is a significant worry about illegitimate distinctions based on sexual preferences, it is not quite as worrisome as it is in the case of race because (a) race is generally more quickly identifiable (visually, often by the name, sometimes by speech patterns, etc.) where sexual preferences are not always quickly identifiable and (b) while homosexual people are finding more acceptance in various parts of society, I think race relations have stagnated, mostly due to the fact that some minority races are on average less educated, more destitute, imprisoned more, etc., and others use those factors as illegitimate proxies for how to treat those minority races.	0.8876	gm
