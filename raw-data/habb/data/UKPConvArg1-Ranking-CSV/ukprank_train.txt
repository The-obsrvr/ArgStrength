A parent shouldn't use spanking as an option to discipline a child because they might grow up traumatized and they might feel unloved since they would get spanked a lot, that will cause a low self of esteem.

I take the view that, school uniform is very comfortable. Because there is the gap between the rich and poor, school uniform is efficient in many ways. If they wore to plain clothes every day, they concerned about clothes by brand and quantity of clothes. Every teenager is sensible so the poor students can feel inferior. Although school uniform is very expensive , it is cheap better than plain clothes. Also they feel sense of kinship and sense of belonging. In my case, school uniform is convenient.

In a perfect world, everyone would not be selfish and would use their talents and abilities for the good of humanity, but we don't live in a perfect world nor will we ever.

It's better to have a father than to not have one. For example, me.

Having a lousy father does not just leaves bumps, scrapes and scars externally. The damage goes much deeper.

The plan consisted of separate areas for different ethnic groups and provision of other facilities such as roads, schools and lands for government buildings. In October 1822, a Town Plan Committee was formed by Raffles to oversee the project.	0.00807

I personally feel that it is better to be fatherless, rather than having a lousy father. I personally know what it is like . My father was very lousy. The last time I saw him was when I was thirteen, and i havn't heard from him since. It doesn't bother me because I don't know him, and because he's not around I am never set up for any disapointment.

It's better to have a lousy father for practical reasons. You can blame every mistake you've made on your father. He won't pry into your business and search your room and take your stuff because he doesnt think I need it. He wouldnt care so much that he would get pissed and throw my backpack with my computer in it at a wall putting a hole in it because I didn't clean the sink after breakfast or I forgot my keys. I think it's actually an opinion because that kind of father is still lousy because he'll tell you that he hates you and I ruined his life.	0.14028
Being fatherless would ensure that the only heartaches you have from him are his absence, and not knowing what he was like. A lousy father could come in gain your trust, and walk out on you. Some would like to believe that just knowing your father is there is enough. To me having a father who does nothing is in itself an absence because either way he knows nothing about you, and you nothing about him.

This argument could go both ways but I would have to agree with being fatherless because to me a lousy father is a father who is never there when you need him to be there or, he is never there to listen to what you have to say that's why being fatherless is better in my opinion because you can imagine your father to be whatever you want him to be and, it makes you a better person and a better father.	0.018090000000000002

I think it's better to have a lousy father then fatherless, because a father just being in the childs life has a huge impact on the child. Without a father, the child will not feel secure in a certain sense. Of course, mothers give that feeling, but fathers give it in another way. A girl for example, girls who have fathers are less careless then girls without. To me, I see girl's who don't have fathers grow up a hard life. Boys, they probably feel like they have to take on the fatherly responsiblity as they get older. Which shouldn't be the case.	0.01431

I think T.V. is more helpful as the you can watch and listen to something being explained like if we read about budding or spore formation we have to create an image about that in mind, but when we watch the animation of budding then we could understand better. Some people can't even imagine so T.V. is helpful. As concerning the time limit or harm to our eyes, we should watch T.V. in a limit, because the excess of everything is harmful, even reading of books. <br/> Surveys have found that a normal person can remember 10% of what he had read and 50% of what he had listened and watched.	0.0042899999999999995
	
	
	
	
If it was the person you truly love and want to spend the rest of your life with then it's a definitely no. People make mistakes but although it's a major crime to murder someone I would still not turn in the person I love the most. If I plan on staying with that person I love for the rest of my life then I would stick with them and never turn them in. And if that means that I am part of that murder by not saying anything, well then so be it.	0.00486
Human nature is to endeavor personal pursuit. If you assume that human nature is to endeavor advancing the common good, then you're going to get screwed by someone who endeavors personal pursuit. Most Americans endeavor advancing the common good; which is why they get screwed by politicians who endeavor personal pursuit. If everyone endeavors personal pursuit, then we would keep each other in check. It is easier to get most people to endeavor personal pursuit than it is to get most people to endeavor advancing the common good; which is why communism failed.	0.007640000000000001

As an ambitious, young person wanting to become a lawful, successful, homicide detective, I would not be lenient with any murderer in my midst. <br/> Hopefully, the murder wouldn't be the result of a pleasure/malicious-kill, so that the sentencing won't be as harsh, but nonetheless, all murderers must be tried. After all, hopefully my spouse will understand that having to live in hiding is basically the same as being in prison except much worse since there would be little chance for parole since they will have to live with the guilt and/or the fear of being caught for the rest of their lives.	0.0075

I believe it is better to have a lousy father than to have none. It is important to have a role model to look up to and without that figure, you might become lost in the world.

It really sucks not having a man to look up to while your growing up. I believe that being fatherless is better then having a lousy father.

So being fatherless is better because from day one you start depending on your own with no need of a father being there.

I think the common good is a better endeavor, because it's better to give then to receive. It's better to give other people you're hand out in help then you holding your own hand.	0.041069999999999995
Love is much greater then any mistake. I know things happen but my wife will be able to confide in me no matter what goes wrong. I made a commitment to stay whit her through rough times and I will. Murder is a unforgivable mistake but love is not.	0.0078
	
	
	
I Believe that its better to have a lously father than no father; because growing up being fatherless would have a major impact on your childhood.Meaning, wondering about who your father was and what he was lousy at or good at. Also growing up without a lously father would mean you cant prove to your father that there is greatness in him; meaning the son he made turns out to become a bright and better person in society.	0.01242

Yes of course. Apart from the health benefits, there's the greater respect for the outdoors, sporting camaraderie, teamwork, reflexive situational calculation to name but a few. Now drop and give me twenty for your insolence!	0.009009999999999999
I rather have a lousy father than not have one at all, because a father is one of the most wonderful things it could happen to you. At least a lousy father would be there when you need someone. You can count on your father on anything. and i guess lousy fathers are like that because they love their child, and they want their son or doughter to be as perfect as posible.	0.03249
Personally i think that if you are not helping yourself you cant help no one else. If you try to help every person that needs your help, they will just slow you down. Don't get me wrong helping people is always right. In the big picture if you pursuit your dreams and get rich, fame, and power you will be able to help the people that matter to you.	0.01124

Evolution is a science. All the refutes I have seen (which I will rebuttal after this) have nothing to do with science. Their claims are theological claims. Lets first know what science is. Science is known through the scientific method. The scientific method deals only with the natural world. Creationism tries to sneak the supernatural as a scientific explanation. This is called pseudo-science.	0.006370000000000001

Farquhar has a boss!(raffles) he has to follow raffles and not go about doing anything else if then why cant farquhar help singapore after he was fired?

I think it's good within certain limits. I went to a school with a uniform, and it was far less stressful than non-uniform college. I'd argue that it's a leveler- prevents people from showing off material wealth/ making others feel bad for not having 'cool' stuff. <br/> But it can be taken too far. By the end, we weren't allowed coloured socks, which was idiotic.	0.00462

Actually the government does tell women what they can and can't do with their bodies <br/> It's illegal to commit suicide <br/> If a person is caught trying to hack themselves to peices they could be placed in a mental institute <br/> So the government actually does limit what a woman can do with her body	0.0065
	
Yes I believe gay marriage should be allowed. Mosy who do not want it to be allowed just dont like homosexuality all together, and therefore the opposing side tends to be prejudice. If two men or two women are happy together, love each other, and want to be with each other forever why shouldn't they be allowed to get married??	0.00573
Christianity is perhaps the most vile ideal to poison the minds of men. It's uses, motives, and fictional stories are quite plainly immoral. <br/> (http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/religion.html) <br/> (http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/whynotchristian.html) <br/> (http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/ 3956.Christopher_Hitchens)	0.00869
	
	
A person should be free to do as he or she pleases. So in my opinion i really dont care much about gay marriage. I think it is in a way wrong but it doesn't really make that much of a big difference in society. So if you want to do it go ahead, it is your life, you make the decisions and choices. In some religions it is frowned upon, and i in a way frown upon it myself but dont let that influence your thoughts, just an opinion. <br/> Life is what you want it to be	0.00792
	
	
I think that children should get spanked once in a while. I got spanked when I was little but I could definitely say that I did learn lessons. Don't spank your kids though with whatever you find, you don't want to kill them !!	0.00534
your argument doesn't hold validity since in the cases you sited, the mental stability and ability to reason are completely compromised. The state intervenes in the cases in instances of mental illness. <br/> You will need to find a better answer. Sorry. Try again.	0.15764

Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience. <br/> Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports. <br/> Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.	0.010209999999999999
	
	
	
	
	
The scientific rigor you mention is not present in evolutionary theory. Here's one example: In the 1800s, Charles Lyell and others came up with dates for the rock strata. Radiometric dating wasn't invented until the 1900s. When it was invented, the techniques were calibrated to match the dates Lyell came up with. To say that this proves the dates that Lyell came up with is a logical fallacy, and it sure doesn't sound like true scientific rigor to me.	0.0059700000000000005
