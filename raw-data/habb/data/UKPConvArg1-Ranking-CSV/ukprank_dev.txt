That is better than no teaching at all I think. He could toughen you up. Also you will at least know who he was and never wonder if your father was a saint or lousy, you already know.	0.01165
If my husband committed murder I wouldn't turn them in because I know he must have had a good reason to do it. Everybody makes mistakes in this world and this would be a wrong decision he took. I love him and I feel that in love we should be by your partner throught the thick and thin no matter what. I wouldn't want my husband to be in jail.	0.00719

A growing embryo is considered human with the heartbeats initiating as early as 21st day of conception. So what if we cannot see the human form, it does have the potential to gain one. <br/> Around 60% of abortions are performed on never married women. Why can't women give the baby up for adoption instead, even if she is raped. If your raped does that give you the right to got out and kill someone?	0.00587

"Frankly, if kids didn't dress like whores and drug dealers all the time then it wouldn't be a problem, but since a lot of them do school districts have to turn to such a thing. <br/> The argument of individuality...who cares? That's a load of bull. Is school the only place these kids go? What is stopping them from going home and putting on different clothes after school? And it isn't the schools job to make sure that every kid gets to ""express their opinion."" School is meant to be a learning environment, not a fashion show or a night club."	0.00722
	
	
	
	
firefox is much better. <br/> It remembers passwords with greater gusto. <br/> add-ons allow you to personalize your browser in every way. I love - tabs (aging and remembering them when you close the browser, weatherfox, gestures, <br/> there is even a tab that lets you display the page in IE format if something is incompatible (rare, only SAP at work) <br/> and the way you can put the link logos in the tool bar rocks. <br/> much friendlier and a better browser, and not just because i don't want to support MS. Because i don't care about that, a good product is a good product.	0.0042899999999999995

i'm not pleased with the idea to increase P.E. requirement. First, i thinks that it is not up to the college to require students to exercise. i believes that students have the responsible to choose whether or not to work out. Also, i says that there shouldn't be any P.E. requirement in the college. According to me, the college is a place to train our brain not our body. i adds that if students do need exercise, they can exercise on their own as me. i goes hiking and plays basketball in my neighborhood.	0.01075
	
	
I think it would be better to have a lousy father because atleast you have someone there. Just because a father is lousy doesn't mean you can't change that. Maybe you could knock some sense into him and he would come around and be a good father. The fact that you would never even get a chance to know your father makes me believe that having a lousy father is better than no father.	0.01239
	
	
	
I would say yes to some circumstances I would say yes but for others it would be a no I will not turn them in. I feel that if my spouse killed a person out of self defense or out of defense for another person then no I wouldn't turn them in. Another circumstance would be if they killed a person for killing someone or something like I that, then no I wouldn't turn them in. If they killed cold heartedly like rape, for money, objects and or just a pure disliking or a person then yes I would turn them in because someone that's that cold could kill me.	0.01269
I believe so, it should be used as a last resort at least because I being a sibling of three, was spanked along with my sister and turned out to be disciplined and on the other hand our youngest sister has never been spanked and she tends to make more mistakes even now that shes 10 than we did.	0.00466

I would turn him in becasue it is wrong for any reason to kill someone. If he can kill one person what says that he will not kill me? Everyone wants to know what happened to their loved ones and that would give them the peace that the person that did it was paying for what he did. Love is not worth the risk of you getting caught for not telling what you know.	0.00976

I think that advancing the common good is better than personal pursuit. The reason for this is that it is better to help others than just to think about yourself. We need to improve our community first before we think about ourselves. If everyone tried to take care of their community then there would be no dangerous places.	0.009290000000000001
	
	
Well I definitely would stick by my vows of marriage through the good times and the bad but I mean some people get married without truly knowing who the person is. Hmmm that is a hard one. Well if I truly loved this person I would not turn them in because, I mean I made a promise to them that they could turn to me for help in thick and thin till death do us part. But there are divorces that happen all the time because for whatever reason, but I don't know this is a toughy.	0.01102
	
"Is marriage really just about ""love?"" I think not. It's about societal norms. It's about legal rights. It's about families. It's about generations. It's about example. It's about commitment. It's about tax breaks. It's about parental roles. If it were just about ""love"" then I could marry my dog and two kids at the local middle-school could get married as well. It's not only about love."	0.00471
	
I can reconfigure Firefox very easily to meet my needs as my life changes. If I need great SEO extensions I can get them. If I need an HTML color picker instead when I get more involved with other elements of site development, FF is easily remodeled to suit my new browsing needs.

"I did not propose ""separate but equal."" I proposed ""distinct and different."" Man/woman relationships, especially in the aggregate, have a very different set of implications than man/man and woman/woman relationships.

it is better to help yourself before you can help others. for instance, if you don't have your life together how are you going to help someone else with theirs. if your still living at home with your mother and you don't have a job and one want to help out by giving to an organization you couldn't do it. so basically you have to help yourself before you can help others.	0.010740000000000001
	
"This is planet Earth, shared by billions, not just you.

I was raised in a Freewill Baptist Church and was lucky to encounter a church full of people who were actually kind and practiced what they preached. Now, I consider myself a non-denominational who still wholly believes in the beliefs and teachings of the Christians, only now I see it like this: I believe in God, not religion.	0.0069
I believe that personal pursuit is better because in order to help others you have to help yoursel first. I also think that if you are happy with yourself and enjoy helping others you have the confidence and strength to help the outside world while satisfying yourself. For example, someone wants to succeed in life and through that he achieves his goals, whenever he is already succesful and with money he decides to help others.	0.01095

If one is in a relationship then yes porn is wrong. No one has the right to tell others what to do, we can only hope to influence. Porn is disgusting. Seriously. It exploits men and women. It is not realistic and can split up relationships. <br/> If a man and a woman or a woman and a woman or man and a man are in a relationship then they should not need any other forms of sexual gratification other than their spouse. Out of love. And respect.	0.006509999999999999

Yes I would be happy and relieved to turn my spouse in for murder. Killing someone is the one number one crime in this world. I don't want to stay married to a crazy woman who commits murder.

year,i support this view. when i was studying in the school,for me wasn't a problem what to wear .

I would much rather have a lousy father that a be fatherless because every dad out there is lousy in their own kind of way. I don't always agree with my dad, we don't always get along, and sometimes, when he gets home from work, he just sits on the couch, watching tv, and waits for my mom to make him food. Thats pretty lousy to me, but at the end of it all, I love him and I don't know what I would do without him. Yeah, he'll get on my nerves sometimes, but he's lived longer than me which makes him wiser in so many different ways.	0.02455
Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions.
